SumofSeries input given by the user:

SumofSeries:

I have created a public class named Series.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I have declared variables n and sum = 0.
I am asking user to input the N value.
I am calculating the sum of the series.
and finally, I am displaying the result.
 i.e, sum of the series upto N.
 
 Testcase:
 
 The series 1+2+3+4+5+..+N is the sum of first N natural numbers.
 To find the sum of this series we have to take the help of loop. 
 
 Input-1:
 
 Enter N value :
 
  6
  
  Output-1:
  
  Sum of series is = 21
  
  Input-2:
  
  Enter the N value :
  
  10
  
  Output-2:
  
  Sum of series is = 55
