//Constructor Overloading
class StuConstructor 
{
    //Instance Variables of the class 
    int id;
    String name;
    StuConstructor()
    {
        System.out.println("This is a Default Constructor");
    }
    StuConstructor(int i,String n)

        id = i;
        name = n;
    }
    void display()

        System.out.println("The student number is "+id);
        System.out.println("The student name is "+name);
    }

class Student
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //Object Creation
        StuConstructor std = new StuConstructor();
        StuConstructor s=new StuConstructor(27,"Hari Krishna");
        s.display();
    }
}

Problem :
  To display Student ID and Student Name by using a Constuctor.
 Solution :
  Constructor Overloading is nothing but a defining a constuctor with multiple constructors within the same class but with different parameters.
  here I am deining a Default Constructor as well as Parameterized Constructor.
  now I am declaring two instance variables id and name in the class.
  and I have created a default constructor to display it is a default constructor.
  I have created a StudentConstructor and intialized Instance variable with i and n and I have used display method to display parameters inside the StuConstructor.
  I have created a main class Student and then I have created two objects for Default Constructor and ParameteriZed Constructor.
  I have declared parameters in the parameterized constructor and I have called the method with the Object.
  Testcases :
  1.while intializing the parameterised constructor if we can put float instead of int that will arise an error.
  2.If we can pass decimal values instead of integer values then there will be an Error.
  Input : 27,Hari Krishna
  Output : 27,Hari Krishna
  Input 2 : 27.5,Hari Krishna
  Out Put 2: Error
