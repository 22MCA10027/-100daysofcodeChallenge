java program to find  the distance between two points:

Firstly, I have created a scanner class named Distance.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am declaring the variables x1,x2,y1,y2,x,y and double distance.
I am asking the user to enter the first point coordinates.
I am storing the first point coordinates in x1 and y1.
I am asking user to enter the second point coordinates.
I am storing the second point coordinatess in x2 and y2.
I am calculating the Distance between two points.
Finally, I am displaying the result,
 i.e., Distance between two points.
 
 Testcase:
 
 Assume we have two points M and N, with coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) respectively. Their distance  can be represented as MN and it can be calculated as given below formula,

The first point (M):- (x1, y1)
Second point (N):- (x2, y2)
Distance (MN):- √((x2 – x1)2 + (y2 -y1)2)

Input-1:

Enter first point coordinates: 4 8
Enter second point coordinates: 12 14

Output-1:

Distance between them = 10.0

Input-2:

Enter first point coordinates: 0 0
Enter second point coordinates: 5 12

Output-2:
Distance between them = 13.0
