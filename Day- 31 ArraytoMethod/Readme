To demonstrate an array to a method:

I have created a public class named ArraySum
I have defined a main method to begin the execution.
I have created an array and intializing with the elements.
I am passing an array to a method
I am writing the logic for addinfg the elements injtialized in
 the array.
finally, I am displaying the sum of the elements that are intialized 
 in the array.
 
 TestCases:
 
 1.If you enter the elements into an array , then it will 
 provide the result as output.
 2.If you did not enter the elements into the array,
 then it will thyrow an array.
 
 Input-1:
 
 1,2,3,4,5
 
 Output-1:
 
 15
 
 input-2:
 
 6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6
 
 Output5--2:
