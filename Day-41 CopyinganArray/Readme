Copying of an array:

firstly, I have created a public class named ArrayCopying.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking the user to enter the size of an array.
I am initializing an array named arr with the size.
I am asking user rto enter the elements into the array.
I am storing the elements into the array given by the user.
I am creating a new array with similar type and size.
I am copying the array using the loop.
I am copying the elements using the loop.
Finally, I am displaying the Original array
 and Copied array.
 
 Testcase:
  
  We have to enter the elements into the array. then
   the elements into the array will be copied.

The copied array is: 2 4 6 8 10 12

Input-2:
