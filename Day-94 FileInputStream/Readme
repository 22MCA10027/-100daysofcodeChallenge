java program to display File Input Stream to read all the characters:

firstly, I have imported a sub package FileInputStream from the java package.
I have ccreated a public class named DataStreamExample.
I  have  defined main method to begin the execution.
I am using try block along with catch block.
I am defininig the file Input Stream and I am displaying the data 
which is present inside the  file.

Test Case-1:

Java FileInputStream class obtains input bytes from a file. 
It is used for reading byte-oriented data (streams of raw bytes) such as image data, 
audio, video etc. You can also read character-stream data.


Test case-2:

If we entered a wrong volume name or file name as wrong 
then, we did not get the data or the information which  is available inside the file.

Input & output-1:

Hi to all
this is Hari Krishna


Input & output-2:

Hi to all

this is Hari Krishna

I am from Andhra Pradesh...
