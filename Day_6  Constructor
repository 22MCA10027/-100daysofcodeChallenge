//Java Program to find the Area of a Rectangle by using Constructor
class Rectangle
{
    int length,width;
    Rectangle(int l,int w)
    {
        length = l;
        width = w;
    }
    int rectArea()
    {
        return(length*width);
    }
}
class Constructor
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle(6,4);
        int area=r.rectArea();
        System.out.println("The Area of a Rectangle is :"+area);
    }
}

Problem : 
We have to findout Area of a rectangle.
Explanation : 
Actually there are so many ways to find out area of a rectangle.
 Now, I am using Constructor method to findout area of a rectangle.
 in which class name is same as method name.
 we know that Area of a Rectangle is Length*Width.
 here, I am taking two variables length and width as Instance Variables and with parameters l,w.
 Input :
         Length=6,Width=4
 Output :
         24
 TestCases :
 Actually there are three possible TestCases as follows
 1.we can input Two Positive Values(6,4) and then the Output will be 24
 2.we can input Two Negative values (-6,-4) and then the  Output will be 24
 3.we may input One Positive and One Negative Value (6,-4) and then the Output will be -24
