SumofSeriesof N*N input given by the user:

SumofSeriesN*N:

I have created a public class named SumofSeriesofNN.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I have declared variables n and sum = 0.
I am asking user to input the N value.
I am calculating the sum of the series.
and finally, I am displaying the result.
 i.e, sum of the series upto N.
 
 Testcase:
 
The series 12 + 22 + 32 + 42 + 52 +….+ n2 or 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*4 + 5*5 +….+ n*n is the sum of square of first N natural numbers.
It is similar to the previous series but we have to add square value of the numbers. 
 
 Input-1:
 
 Enter N value :
 
  6
  
  Output-1:
  
  Sum of series is = 91
  
  Input-2:
  
  Enter the N value :
  
  2
  
  Output-2:
  
  Sum of series is = 5
