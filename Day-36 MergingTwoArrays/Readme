Java programto merge two arrays into a single array:

Firstly, I am creating a public class named ArrayMerge.
I am defining the main method to begin the execution.
I am intializing two arrays arr1 and arr2 to merge these two 
 arrays into a single array.
I am creating a new array, then
I am copying first array to new array from 0 to arr1.length
similarly, 
I am copying second array to new array.
and finally,
I am displaying first array, second array and 
 the merged array.
 
 Testcases:
 
 1.we have to intialize two arrays with the group of elements, then 
  it will be merge the two arrays into a single array.
  
 Input-1:
 
 arr1 = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
 
 arr2 = 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 100
  
 Output-1:
 
 arr1 = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
 
 arr2 = 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 100
 
 Merged array = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 100
 
 Input-2:
 
 arr1 = 10, 10, 10, 20
 
 arr2 = 20, 30
 
 Output-2:
 
 arr1 = 10, 10, 10, 20
 
 arr2 = 20, 30
 
 Merged array = 10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 30
