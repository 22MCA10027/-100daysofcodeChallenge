Java program to take input from the user and to find factorial method using recursion in a single line:

I have imported a Scanner class from the java package.
I have created a public class named FactorialRecursion.
I have crerated a Recursive method to find factorial of a number.
I am using the ternary opeerator.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I am declaring the variables.
number of int type and result of long type.
I have created a Scanner class object to take input fromthe user.
I am asking user to Enter an integer number.
I am storing the value int o the variable number.
I am calulating the factorial number.
finally, I am displaying the result and closing the Scanner class.

Test case-1:

The general case for to find the factorial is factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1).

Test case-2:

The ternary operator can be used to develop factorial method in a single line.

Input-1:

Enter an integer number:: 10

Output-1:

Factorial = 3628800

Input-2:

Enter an integer number:: 66

Output-2:

Factorial = 0
