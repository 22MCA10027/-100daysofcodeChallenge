Java program to take input from the userand to check whether the given number is a perfect square or not:

I have imported a Scanner class from the Java package.
I have created a public class named PerfectSquare.
I have defined a method to check the given number is a perfect number or not.
I am calculating the square root of a number
I am checking square root is an integer or not
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I am declaring the variables number of double type and result of boolean type as false.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to Enter any number.
I am storing the value into the variable number.
I am checking the number whether it is a perfect square or not and 
I am displaying the result that the given number is a perfect square 
or not a perfect square.
finally, I am closing the Scanner class.

Test case:

The Math.sqrt() method returns the square root of the number. 
If the result is an integer number then the given number is a perfect square 
else it is not a perfect square.

Input-1:

Enter a number::8.6

Output-1:

Not a Perfect Square

Input-2:

Enter a number::625

Output-2:

Perfect Square
