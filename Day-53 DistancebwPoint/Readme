Distance between two points:

I have  created a public class Point.
I have declared the variables x1, x2, y1, y2.
I have created a method setdata 
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter x1 point, x2 point, y1 point, y2 point
and I am storing the points into x1, x2, y1 and y2.
I have created a calculate method .
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created an array and declared size with 10 
I have created an othe scanner class to  take input from the user.
 I am asking user to enter the number of coordinates.
 I am storing the array size n.
 
 Testcase:
 
 The X and Y coordinates of 10 different points are entered through the keyboard.
 Write a program to findthe distance of last point from the first point (sum of distance between consecutive points)
 
 Input & Output-1:
 
 Enter the number rof coordinates:
  2
 Enter the x1 point : 2 
 Enter the x2 point : 4
 Enter the y1 point : 6
 Enter the y2 point : 8
  2.8284
 Enter the x1 point : 12
 Enter the x2 point : 16
 Enter the y1 point : 22
 Enter the y2 point : 26
   5.6568
   
Input & Output-2:

 Enter the number rof coordinates:
  1
 Enter the x1 point : 1
 Enter the x2 point : 3
 Enter the y1 point : 5
 Enter the y2 point : 7
   2.8284
