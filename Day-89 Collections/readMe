Java program to implement Linked list by using the collection framework:

I have imported util subpackage from the java package.
I have created a class named as CollectionExample.
I have defined main  method to begin the execution.
I have defined LinkedList.
I am adding the names to the list.
I am defining theIterator and 
finally, I am displaying the names in a list.

Test Case:

LinkedList implements the Collection interface.
It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements.
It can store the duplicate elements.
It maintains the insertion order and is not synchronized. 
In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.

Input & Output:

Balaji
Aadarsh
