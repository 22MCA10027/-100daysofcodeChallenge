Inserting the elements into an array:

Firstly, I have created a default class named ArrayInsert.
I have declared a main method to begin the execution.
I am taking three variables n,m,p
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
and I am asking user to enter the size o fan array
I have created two arrays a and b and storing the elements into it.
I am asking user to enter the index value where he/she wants 
 to enter the element into the array.
 I am taking the element from the user and I am inserting it into the array 
 at the index givn by the user.
 Finally, I am displaying the elements after Insertion.
 
 TestCases:
 
 1.An  element can be inserted at the index, If you enter an element.
 2.An element can't be inserted at the index, If you did't enter an element
     and an exception also raised.
