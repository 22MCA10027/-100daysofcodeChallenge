Java program to remove the duplicate elements in an array:

Firstly, I have creatged a public class named ArrayDuplicate.
I have defined main method  to begin the execution.
I am initializing an array with the elements 
I am defining a new array named newArray to remove 
the duplicate elements in the given array.
I am displaying the both arrays before removal of duplicate elements 
and after removing the duplicate elements in an array.
I am initializing j = 0 for index without duplicates.
I am writinfg a loop for to iterate an array. then
I am returning a new copied array.

TestCases:

1. We have to input number of elements in an array,
If any element which is repeated then It will be removed.
2. If there is no repeated elements in the given array, then 
there is no need to remove the duplicate elements in the
 given array.
 
 Input-1:
 
 10, 20, 30, 30, 40, 40, 40, 50,60, 60 
 
 Output-1:
 
 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60
 
 Input-2:
 
 10, 10, 10, 20, 40, 60, 60, 80, 90, 90, 90, 100, 100
 
 Output-2:
 
 10,20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 100
