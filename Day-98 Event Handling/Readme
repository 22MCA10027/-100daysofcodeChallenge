Java program to create a basic calculator by using the Event Handling

Basic Components of a GUI:

1.Pointer: It is a symbol that appears on the display screen. It can be moved to select commands and objects.
2.Pointing device: It allows you move the pointer and select objects on the screen, e.g. mouse or trackball.
3.Icons: It refers to small images on the display screen that represent commands, files, windows etc. Using pointer and pointing device,
you can execute these commands.
4.Desktop: It is the display screen that contains the icons.

Explanation:

I have created a main class named as Calculator and 
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have  create a frame
I have create a textfield
I have store operator and operands
I have default constructor
again, I have create a frame
I have set look and feel
I have created an object of class
and create a textfield
set the textfield to non editable
// create number buttons and some operators
        // create number buttons
 // equals button
        // create operator buttons

   // create . button

      // create a panel
        // add action listeners
 
        // add elements to panel
  // set Background of panel
        // add panel to frame
 // if the value is a number
// if operand is present then add to second no

            // set the value of text
   // clear the one letter
            // set the value of text
            // store the value in 1st
                         
   // set the value of text
            // convert it to string
            // if there was no operand
            // else evaluate
                // store the value in 1st
 // convert it to string
                // place the operator
                // make the operand blank
            // set the value of text
            
   at the end I am displaying the calculator.
