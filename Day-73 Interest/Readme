Java program to take input from the user and  to display the simple interest and the total amount:

firstly, I am importing the scanner class.
I have created a public class named SimpleInterest .
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have declared principalAmount as double and initializing with 0.0. 
I have declared  rate as double and initializing with 0.0.
I have declared time as double and initializing with 0.0.
I have declared interest as double and initializing with 0.0.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the principal amount.
I am storing value into the principal amount. 
I am asking user to enter the time in months.
I am storing value into the months. 
I am asking user to enter the interest rate.
I am storing value into the interest rate. 
then  interest = (principalAmount * rate * time) / 100;
finally, I am displaying the Simple Interest and the total amount to pay.

TestCase:

1) Define class and the main method
2) Declare variables for taking inputs:- principal amount, time, and interest rate
3) import Scanner class of util package to read inputs
4) Read inputs from end-user and store them in the declared variables
5) Calculate simple interest using the formula, and store it in a variable
6) Display the simple interest
7) Close the Scanner class object

Input-1:

Enter principal amount:: 100000
Enter time (in months):: 12
Enter  the  interest rate (per year):: 2

 
Output-1:
 
Simple interest = 24000.0
Total amount to pay = 124000.0
 
Input-2:

Enter principal amount:: 1000000
Enter time (in months):: 12
Enter  the  interest rate (per year):: 2

Output-2:
 
Simple interest = 240000.0
Total amount to pay = 1240000.0
