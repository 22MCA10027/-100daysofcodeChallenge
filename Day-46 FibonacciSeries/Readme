Fibonacci Series:

Firstly, I have created a public class named FibonacciSeries.
I have created a static method displayfib and defined with int term.
I have initialized t1 with zero.
I have initialized t2 with 1.
I have initialized n.
I have initialized i with 1.
I am using while loop , while(i<=term) 
I am displaying the numbers upto the term.
I am updating the term values
I am increasing the iterative variable value by 1.
I am defining the main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the number of terms.
I am displaying Fibonacci Series.
finally, I am closing the Scanner class.

TestCase:

 In the Fibonacci series, the next element will be the sum of the previous two elements. 
 The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. 
 Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so onâ€¦


Input-1:

Enter the number of terms: 7

Output-1:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8

Input-2:

Enter the number of terms: 10

Output-2:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
