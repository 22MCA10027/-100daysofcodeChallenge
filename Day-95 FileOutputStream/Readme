java program to display File Output Stream :

firstly, I have imported a sub package FileOutputStream from the java package.
I have ccreated a public class named FileExample.
I  have  defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created a fileoutputstream object
I have transfered this string to the files
We will write the string by writing each
character one by one to file
by doing fout.close() all the changes which have
been made till now in RAM had been now saved to the hard disk.

Test Case:

This will enable us to write data to the file. 
Then, to write data to the file, we should write data using the FileOutputStream as,
fout.write();
Then we should call the close() method to close the fout file.

Input & output:

Hi to all

I am from Andhra Pradesh...TATA
