}

Problem :
java program to implement the Inheritance
Solution :
I have declared two variables i and j in the class A.
and I have used show method to display i and j values.
I have created a class B and I have used "extends" keyword to inherit the properties of class B.
I have declared a variable k and have used showk method to display k.
again i have used an other method "sum" to add the variables i and j
and then I have created a main class named "Inheritance" and created two objects a1 and b1 to call the methods in the classes A and B.

Test Cases :
 1.In the inheritance subclass can be inherit the properties of superclass
 2.and Superclass can't be inherit the properties of subclass.
 
 Input :
 i = 10
 j = 20
 Output :
 sum(i+j) = 30
