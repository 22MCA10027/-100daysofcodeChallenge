Java program to count the Odd and Even numbers:

firstly,I have created a public class named ArrayOddEven.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to eter the size of an Aarray.
I have created an sized n.
I have created an array named numbers.
I am askinng user to enter the elements into the array.
I am writing the logic for a method to count odd and even numbers
 in a given array and I am displaying it.
I am traversing the array
finally, I am displaying the result as number of odd and even numbers 
  can be displayed.
  
  TestCases:
  
  1.If we enter the even number the group of elements in the array, then
   It will count the number of even numbers and it will display it.
  2.similarly, If we can enter the Odd number in the group of elements in an array,
   then it will count the number odd numbers then it will display it's count.
   
   Input-1:
   
    Enter the size of an array
      6
     Enter the elements into the array
      1,2,3,4,5,6
      
      Output-1:
       
        Count of Even numbers = 3
        Count of Odd numbers = 3
    Input-2:
    
     Enter the size of an array
      8
     Enter the elements into the array
      1,2,2,3,4,5,6,6
      
      Output-1:
       
        Count of Even numbers = 5
        Count of Odd numbers = 3
