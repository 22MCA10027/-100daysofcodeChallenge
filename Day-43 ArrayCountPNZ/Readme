java program to count Positive, Negative and Zeroes in an Array.

Array Count:

Firstly, I have created a public class named ArrayCount.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the length of the array.
I am creating an array named numbers and initialized with size n.
I am asking user to enter the elements into the array.
I am storing the elements sinto the array.
I am closing the Scanner class.
I am defining the method to count the number of positive,
 negative and Zeroes in the given array.
I am checking each and every element, whether it is a positive, 
negative and zeroes int the array.
finally, I am displaying the number of positive, negative 
and zeroes in an array the input given by the user.

Test Case:

We have to enter the elements into the array, then it will count 
the number of positive, negative and zeroes in an array.

Input-1:
 
 Enter the size of an array:
  6
 Enter the elements into the array:
  0
  2
  -4
  6
  -8
  10
  
 Output-1:
 
 Positive numbers = 3
 Negative numbers = 2
 Zeroes = 1
 
 Input-2:
 
 Enter the size of an array:
  2
 Enter the elements into the array:
  0
  2
    
 Output-2:
 
 Positive numbers = 1
 Negative numbers = 0
 Zeroes = 1
