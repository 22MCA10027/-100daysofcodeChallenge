Java program to find average of an array:

firstly, I have created a public class named ArrayAverage.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the size of an array.
I have created an array.
I am asking user to enter the elements into the array.
I am storing the elements into the array.
I am initializing sum to 0.0.
I am initializing avg to 0.0.
avg = sum/array.length then 
I am displaying the average of an array.

Testcase:

then average will be displayed based on our input.
