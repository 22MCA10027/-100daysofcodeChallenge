Anagram:

The dictionary meaning of the word anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters.
Two strings are said to be anagrams if they make a meaningful word by rearranging 
 or shuffling the letters of the string. In other words, 
we can say that two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters but in a different order.
Note that a letter has to be used only once.
