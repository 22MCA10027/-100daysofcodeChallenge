java program to take input from the user and to display the area of a circle.

firstly, I have imported a Scanner class from the java package.
I have created a public class named CircleArea.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution
I have declared the variables radius and area as double 
 and initialized with zeroes.
I have created a Scanner class to tske input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the radius of a circle.
I am storing the radius of the circle into the radius.
I am calculating the area of a circle.
area = Math.PI*radius*radius.
finally, I am displaying the area of a circle and
I am closing the Scanner class.

TestCase:

1) Define a class and main method
2) Declare a variable for taking input:- radius
3) Import Scanner class of util package to read input
4) Read input from end-user and store them in the declared variable
5) Calculate area using the formula, and store it in a variable
6) Display the result
7) Close the Scanner class object
// calculate area
area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
Or use,
area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);

Input-1:

Enter the radius of circle:: 6

Output-1:

Area of circle = 113.09733552923255


Input-1:

Enter the radius of circle:: 96

Output-1:

Area of circle = 28952.917895483533
