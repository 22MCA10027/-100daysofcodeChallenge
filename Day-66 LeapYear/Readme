Java program to print leap year

I have created a public  class named LeapYearN.
I have written the method isLeapYear and passing Year as a parameter in it.
and
I have written the condition here.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have declared the variables year = 0.
and boolean result = false.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.;
i am asking user to enter the year 
I am checking the year whether it is a leap year or not.
I am displying the year whether it is a leap year or not a leapyear.
I am closing the Scanner class.
