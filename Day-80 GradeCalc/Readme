Java Program to take input from the user and to Find out Students Grades using Switch Case:

firstly, I have imported a Scanner class from the java package.
I have created a public class named Gradecalculator.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
The score should be in between 0-100.
I am asking user to enter his/her score.
I am storing the score into a variable score of int type.
I am starting the switch case.
if the score is >= 90 then he will get A grade.
if the score is >=80 and <=90, then he will get B grade.
if the score is >=70 and <=80, then he will get C grade.
if the score is >=60 and <=70, then he will get D grade.
if the score is >=50 and <=60, then he will get E grade.
if the score is <50 then he / she will get F grade.
finally, I am displaying the result.

TestCase:

In this example, we had taken score value directly and finding the grade based on that score. 
Since it is checking grades only for the 1 subject therefore the score must be within the 0-100 range. 
The break keyword is mandatory else we will always get a grade = F.

Input-1:

Enter your Score
99

Output-1:

Your Grade is = A

Input-2:

Enter your Score
26

Output-2:

Your Grade is = F
