Binary Search:
 
 Firstly I have created a class named Binary
 and have declared two local variables a[] and target
 Input low as 1
 intialize high = length(A)-1
 check condition in while loop low<=high
 if while loop is true, then mid = (low+high)/2
 then it returns mid
 else if mid < target then it returns low=mid+1
  otherwise high = mid-1
  I have created a main class BinarySearch and  defined main method
  i have created a n object for accessing the class.
  whith the help of the object i have called the bin method.
  
  TestCases:
  1.If the target is found in the array of elements, then it returns the location of the element.
  2.If the target is not found in the array of elements,then it returns 0.
