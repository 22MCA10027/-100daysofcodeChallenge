Diamond Pattern for different testcase:

Java program to display Diamond Patteern:

Firstly, I have created a public class named DiamondPatterndiff.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created Scanner class to take input from the user.
I have initialized a variable n with zero.
I am asking user to enter the N value.
I am storing the value into the variable n given by the user.
I have created a printStarDiamond method and passing parameter n.
if,n<0 thenI am displaying to enter the positive number.
for first half portion I am printing the sstar,space, new line.
for second half portion I am printing the sstar,space, new line.
Finally, I am displaying the Diamond pattern.
