Length of an Array:

I have created a public class named LengthofanArray.
I have defined a main method to begin the execution.
I have created an array named a and defined with size 6.
I have created a Scanner class to receive input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the elements into the array.
I am calculating the length of an array with the help of length.
Finally, I am displaying the length of an array and elements entered by the user.

TestCases:

1.If you enter the elements into the array, then It will display
    the length of an array.
2.If you don't enter the elements into the array, then It will not display
    the length of an array.
  and it will throw exception.
  
  Input-1:
   
   Enter the elements into the array
     11
     22
     33
     55
     44
     66
     
   Output-1
   
   The elements are 11 22 33 55 44 66
   The length of an array is 6.
   
   Input-2:
   
   Enter the elements into the array
   1
   2
   3
   a
   
   Output-2:
   
   Exception.
