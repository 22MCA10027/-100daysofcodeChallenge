I have created a class named as CollectionExample.
I have defined main  method to begin the execution.
I have defined Stack.
I am adding the names to the list.
I am defining theIterator and 
finally, I am displaying the names in a list.

The stack is the subclass of Vector. It implements the last-in-first-out data structure, 
i.e., Stack. The stack contains all of the methods of Vector class 
and also provides its methods like boolean push(), boolean peek(), boolean push(object o), which defines its properties.
