java program to implement multithreading by using synchronization in Banking:

I have created a public class named Banking.
I have defined a main method to begin the execution.
I have crerated an instance for Withdraw and Deposit and 
I have defined two objects w and d.
  if(balance>wd)
I am displaying the Withdrawl amount and
Balance after withdrawl
else
Insufficient Balance.
and also
if(balance>0)
I am displaying the deposited amount 
Balance after deposit
Negative amount can't be deposit 

Test case:

Multi-threaded programs may often come to a situation where multiple threads try to access 
the same resources and finally produce erroneous and unforeseen results. 

So it needs to be made sure by some synchronization method that only one thread can access the resource at a given point in time.
Java provides a way of creating threads and synchronizing their tasks using synchronized blocks. 
Synchronized blocks in Java are marked with the synchronized keyword. 

Input & Output:

Withdrawl amount is 2000
Balance after withdrawl 98000
deposited amount is 6000
Balance after deposit 104000
