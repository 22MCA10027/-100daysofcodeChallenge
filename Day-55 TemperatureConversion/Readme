Java program to convert Fahrenheit to celsius:

Firstly, I have created a public class named TemperatureFartoCel.
method to convert fahrenheit to celsius 
I have defined the main method to begin the execution
I have declared the variables celcius and fahrenheit with double datatype.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am assking user to enter the fahrenheit value.
I am storing the value into the variable fahrenheit.
I am converting the fahrenheit into the celcius. 
I am displaying the result.
 
Testcase:

Previously we have developed a Java program to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. In a similar way, we can also write Java program to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

The formula that will be used for this problem is, ⁰C = ( 5 / 9 ) * ( ⁰F – 32 )

Input-1:

Enter the fahrenheit value

 66
 
Output-1:
 
Celcius value = 18.19

Input-2:

Enter the Fahrenheit value

 98.0
 
Output-2:
 
Celcius value = 37.00
