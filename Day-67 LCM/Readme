Java program to find LCM of two numbers:

I have created a public class named LcmProgram.
I have  ctreated a method findLCM and passing parameters n1 and n2
I have declared a temperory variable to store lcm.
I am findig smallest and largest numbers.
I am assign smallest number to minMultiple
I am using while loop here.
I am defining main method to begin the execution.
I am declaring the variables nnumber1 and number2 
and initializing with zeros
I am initializing long lcm with zero.
I am creating Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter two integer numbers.
I am finding LCM for both numbers.
I am displaying the LCM for two numbers.
I am closing the Scanner class.

TestCase:

Enter two integer numbers:: 12 15
Smallest number = 12
Largest number = 15
minMultiple = 12

Iteration 1,
12%15 != 0
minMultiple =12+12
minMultiple = 24

Iteration 2,
24%15 != 0
minMultiple =24+12
minMultiple = 36

Iteration 3,
36%15 != 0
minMultiple =36+12
minMultiple = 48

Iteration 4,
48%15 != 0
minMultiple =48+12
minMultiple = 60

Iteration 5,
60%15 == 0
LCM(12,15) = 60

Input -1:
  
  Enter two integer numbers: 3 4
  
OutPut-1:

  LCM(3,4) = 12
  
Input-2:
  
   Enter two integer numbers:
    
OutPut-2:
  
   LCM(6,9) = 18
