Sum of diagonal elements of an array:

I am creating a public class named ArrayDiag
I am defining a main method to begin the execution.
I am creating a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am aski n g user to enter the row size.
I am asking user to enter the column size.
I am de3claring a two dim3entional array named a with row size m and column size n.
I am asking user to enter the elements into an array.
 then, I am storing the elements into the array.
I am adding the diagonal elements in an array.
and finally I am displaying the result.

Testcase:

We have to enter the elements into an array. 
It will stores the elements in the form of matrix and
then It will add the diagonal elwements in the matrix and 
It will display the result.

Input -1:

     1 2 3 
     4 5 6 
     7 8 9 
     
Output-1:
     
     the Sum of diagonal elements are  15
     
Input -2:

     11 22 33 
     44 55 66 
     77 88 99 
     
Output-1:
     
     the Sum of diagonal elements are  165
