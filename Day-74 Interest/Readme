Java program to take input from the user and  to display the Compound interest and the total amount:

firstly, I am importing the scanner class.
I have created a public class named SimpleInterest .
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have declared principal as double and initializing with 0.0. 
I have declared  rate as double and initializing with 0.0.
I have declared time as double and initializing with 0.0.
I have declared number as integer and initializing with 0.0.
I have declared totalAmount as double and initializing with 0.0.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the principal amount.
I am storing value into the principal. 
I am asking user to "Enter the annual compound " and "interest rate"
and I am storing in the rate.
I am asking user to enter the time in months.
I am storing value into the months. 
I am asking user to Enter the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
I am storing value into the number. 
then  I am calculating the total amount 
 i.e., totalAmount = principal * 
                 Math.pow( 1+(rate/number), number*time);
I am calculating the compound interest interest = totalAmount - principal;
finally, I am displaying the Compound Interest and the total amount to pay.

TestCase :

To calculate the compound interest we need to find the power.
For this purpose, we can use a pre-defined static method pow(double a, double b) of the Math class. It is a static method 
so, to call the pow(-,-) method no need to create an object of the Math class


Input-1:


Enter principal amount:: 5000
Enter the annual compound interest rate:: 5
Enter time (in years):: 10
Enter the number of times that interest is compounded per year:: 12

 
Output-1:
 
Compound interest = 3235.0474884514006
Total amount = 8235.0474884514
 
Input-2:

Enter principal amount:: 1500
Enter the annual compound interest rate:: 4.3
Enter time (in years):: 6
Enter the number of times that interest is compounded per year:: 4

Output-2:

Compound interest = 438.83682213410543
Total amount = 1938.8368221341054
