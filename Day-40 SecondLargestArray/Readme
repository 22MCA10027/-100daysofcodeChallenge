Second Largest element of an Array:

Firstly, I have created a public class named SecondLargest.
I am defining a method to find 2nd largest number in an array.
I am declaring thwe variables fmax and smax.
I am assigning the first element into fmax and smax.
I am defining the main method to begin the execution.
I am creating a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am declaring the variables length and 
I am intializing the numbers into null.
I am asking user to enter the length of an array.
I am asking user to enter the elements into the array.
I am closing the Scanner class then
finally, I am displaying the Second largest element
among the numbers in the array given by the user.

Testcase:
 
 1.We have to enter the number of elements into an array,
 then the Secongd largest number in the list of elements given by us.
 
 2.If we can declare the size of an array as 1 then the Single number
 what you have entered can be displayed as Second Largest element in the given array.

Input-1:

Enter the length of an array:
 6
Enter the elements into the array:
 11
 22
 33
 44
 55
 66
 
 Output-1:
  
  The Second largest element among the given numbers in the array is 55
  
  Input-1:

Enter the length of an array:
 1
Enter the elements into the array:
