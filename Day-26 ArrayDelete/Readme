Array Deletion:

Firstly, I have created a public class named ArrayDelete.
I have defined a main method to begin the execution.
I am taking two variables n amd m.
and I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am aking user to enter the size of an array.
I am intializing two arrays a and b.
I am receiving the elements from the user and
 I am inserting the elements into the array.
again, I am asking user to enter the index value to delete 
 an element at his/her desired location.
Finally, I am deleting an element at the user's 
 desired index.
 
 TestCases:
 
 1.An elementcan be deleted at the index, If you enter an element.
 2.An element can't be deleted at the index, If you didn't enter an element.
