Strings:
 
  I have created a class named Strings
  I have declared main method
  I have declared and created Strings firstname, lastname and surename  using Literarls.
  I have printed the Strings with the help of strings.
  
  Testcases:
  
  1.we can enter charectors for strings.
  2.localization concerns regarding number formats (decimals / commas)
  3.escape character, and ending a string with the escape character - for example if your escape character is ^, and the user inputs something like See above^
new lines in a string intended as single-line.
4.the list is endless though because it really depends on how you intend to use the string, and where it came from.
