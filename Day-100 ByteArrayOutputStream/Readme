Java program to implement ByteArray outputStream:

The ByteArrayOutputStream class of the java.io package can be used to read an array of Output data (in bytes).

It extends the OutputStream abstract class.

Java ByteArrayOutputStream Class :

Java ByteArrayOutputStream class is used to write common data into multiple files. In this stream,
 the data is written into a byte array which can be written to multiple streams later.

The ByteArrayOutputStream holds a copy of data and forwards it to multiple streams.

The buffer of ByteArrayOutputStream automatically grows according to data.

public class ByteArrayOutputStream extends OutputStream

Explanation:

I have imported sub packages io from the java package.
I have created a class named ByteOutputStream.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created an instance of ByteArrayOutputStream.
finally, I am displaying the result as follows:

Buffer as a string
This should end up in the array
Into array
This should end up in the array
Toan OutputStream()
Doing a reset
XXX

Test case-1:

Buffer as a string
This should end up in the array
Into array
This should end up in the array
Toan OutputStream()
Doing a reset
YYY

Test case-2:

Buffer as a string
This should end up in the array
Into array
This should end up in the array
Toan OutputStream()
Doing a reset
bbb

Test case-3:

Buffer as a string
This should end up in the array
Into array
This should end up in the array
Toan OutputStream()
Doing a reset
HHH

Contents that written into test.txt are :

This should end up in the array
