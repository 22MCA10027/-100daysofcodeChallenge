Java program to count number of Odd and Even in an array input given by the user.

ArrayCountOddEven:

firstly, I have created a public class named ArrayOddEven.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have  created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the length of an array.
I am asking user to enter the elements into the array.
I am storing elements into the array.
I am defining the method for to the Odd numbers.
I am defining the method to count the Even numbers.
I am closing the Scanneer class.
finally, I am displaying the count of Odd numberrs 
 and the count of even numbers.
 
 Testcase:
 
 We have to enter the elements into an array,
 1. If there are Odd numbers present in the array then 
  the count of the Odd numbers will be displayed.
 2.If there are Even numbers present in the array then 
  the count of the Even numbers will be displayed.
  3. If there are no Odd and no Even numbers then it will 
    return 0.
