Java program to find the largest number among three numbers:

I have created a public class named LargestNumber.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I am declaring the vriables num1, num2, num3 with double
 and initializing with zeroes.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter three numbers.
I am storing those numbers in num1, num2 and num3
if num1 is graterthan num2 and num3 then num1 is largest
   else num3 is largest.
if num2 is graterthan num3 then num2 is largest.
finally, I am displaying the Largest number among threee numbers
 and I am closing the Scanner class.

TestCase:
