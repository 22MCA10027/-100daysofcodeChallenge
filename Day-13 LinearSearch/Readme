LinearSearch:

   create a class named Linear
   I have created a boolean method Linears and passing a[] and key.
   then, Intialize i value as 1
   then, check i<=n and A[i]!=key until these conditions will be satisfied.
   If the condition in the while loop is true, then increment i value by 1
   after termination of while loop , then check i<=n
   i<=n,then it returns true 
   Otherwise it returns false
   then create a main class named LinearSearch
   and create an object for calling the class.
   with the help of Search object call the method.
   
   
TestCases:

1.If the keyelement is found in the array of elements,then it returns true.
2.If the keyelement is not found in the array of elements,then it returns false.

Input and Output:
