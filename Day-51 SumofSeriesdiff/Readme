Sum of series for different testcase:

Sum of series for different Testcase:

I have created a public class named Seriessum.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I have declared variables n, long factorial = 0 and sum = 0.0.
I am asking user to input the value of of N.
I am calculating the sum of the series.
and finally, I am displaying the result.
 i.e, sum of the series upto N.
 recursive java method to find factorial of a number using if-else statement.
 
 Testcase:
 
To write a Java program for the sum of series 1/1! + 2/2! + 3/3! + …… + N/N!,
we must know how to find the factorial value of a number in Java.
We will use the loop and the 1 will be divided by the factorial value of the iterator variable 

 
 Input-1:
 
 Enter N value :
 
  6
  
  Output-1:
  
  Sum of series is = 2.71
  
  Input-2:
  
  Enter the N value :
  
  2
  
  Output-2:
  
  Sum of series is = 2.0
