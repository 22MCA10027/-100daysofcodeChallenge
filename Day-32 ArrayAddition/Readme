Java Program to perform Addition Operations:

firstly,I have created a default class named ArrayAddition.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I am taking two arrays and intializing with the elements in it.
I am taking i for rows and I am taking j for columns.
I am displaying the sum of the elements in the rows
I am displaying the elements of array in the column
and finally, I am displaying the total sum of elements of an array.

Testcases:

1.Array size can be defined properly.then enter the elements into to
the array to perform
  whatever operations you want.
  
  Input:
   
    1,2,3
    4,5,6
    7,8,9
    
   Output:
   
    Sum of row 1 is 6
    Sum of row 2 is 15
    Sum of row 3 is 24
    Sum of column 1 is 12
    Sum of column 2 is  15
    Sum of column 3 is  18
    Total sum of elements of array is 45
