Java to display ASCII value of alphabets in Java

firstly, I am importing Scanner class from java package.
I have created a public class named AlphabetASCIIValue.
I have declared a char variable ch.
I have declared a int variable value.
I have created Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter an alphabet.
and I am storing the alphabet into ch.
I am converting the char to Ascii value.
I am display ascii value
 Or  we can directly display ASCII value
   by using type-casting (int)ch
 finally, I am closing the Scanner class object.

TestCase:

char ch= 'a';
//direct assigning
int n1 = ch; 
//type-casting
int n2 = (int)ch;
The n1 and n2 variables hold the ASCII value of the character ‘a’.
 The below-given program demonstrates it.

Input-1:

Enter an alphabet:: a

Output-1:

ASCII value of a = 97
ASCII value of a = 97

Input-2:

Enter an alphabet:: 1

Output-2:

ASCII value of 1 = 49
ASCII value of 1 = 49
