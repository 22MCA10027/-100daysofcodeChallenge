Arranging the elements into Ascending order in an Array:

Firstly, I have created a public class AscendingArray.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have created an array named a and I have defined its size as 5.
and also I have taken a temperory variable.
I am defining a Scanner class to take input from the user.
and I am asking user to enter the elements into the Array.
Here I am using the Bubble Sosrt for arranging the data into Ascending Order.
Finally, I am displaying the elements in the array after arranging the elements into 
 an Ascending Order.
