Java program to display BorderLayout by using Swing:

I have imported two sub-packages swing,awt fram java package.
I have imported the sub packages ActionEvent and ActionListner from the java package.
I have created a class named BorderLayoutDemo.
I have defined a main method to begin the execution.
I am printing Up,Down,Left, right and Middle by creating  instance to Jbutton.
I have created instance to Jpanel.
I am defining the setVisible as true.  
finally, I am displaying the BorderLayout.

Testcase:

BorderLayout is the default layout for the window objects such as JFrame,
JWindow, JDialog, JInternalFrame etc. BorderLayout arranges the components in the five regions.
Four sides are referred to as north, south, east, and west. The middle part is called the center.
Each region can contain only one component and is identified by a corresponding 
constant as NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, and CENTER. 

Output : 
     
        U
     
Left   Middle  Right
        
        Down
