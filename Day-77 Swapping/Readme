Java program to take input from the user and to Swap two numbers

I have imported Scanner class from the java package.
I have created a public class named Swappingoftwo
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have declared three variables x,y and temp as int type.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking the user to enter any two numbers.
I am storing the values entered by the user into the variables x and y.
I am displaying values before swapping.
after that I am Swapping the numbers with the help of temp variable and
I am displaying the values after swapping.
finally, I am closing the Scanner class.

Testcase-1:

x = 10, y = 20
temp = x => temp = 10 (temp is hold value of x)
x = y=> x = 20 ( now, x is holding value of y)
y = temp => y = 10 (now, y is holding previous value of x)

Testcase-2:

We have different ways to swap two numbers without using third variable in Java. 
We can use a combination of operators like (+, -), (*,/) and XOR operator.

Input-1:

Enter any two numbers: 26
                       96
Output-1:

Values before Swapping,
x=26     y=96
Values After Swapping,
x=96     y=26

Input-2:

Enter any two numbers: 126
                       243
Output-2:

Values before Swapping,
x=126    y=243
Values After Swapping,
x=243    y=126
