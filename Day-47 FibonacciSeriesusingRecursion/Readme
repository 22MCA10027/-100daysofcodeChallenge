Fibonacci Series by using Recursion:

Firstly, I have created a public class named FibonacciSeriesR.
I have created a static int method fibonacci and passing  with parameter n.
If n < = 1 then, return n.
else 
return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
I am defining the main method to begin the execution.
I am initializing a vatiable n.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the number of terms.
I am displaying Fibonacci Series.
finally, I am closing the Scanner class.

TestCase:

 Here, I am using recursion method to find the fibonacci series, that means Recursion is 
 The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion 
 and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. 
 In the Fibonacci series, the next element will be the sum of the previous two elements. 
 The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. 
 Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so onâ€¦


Input-1:

Enter the number of terms: 7

Output-1:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8

Input-2:

Enter the number of terms: 10

Output-2:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
