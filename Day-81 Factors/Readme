Java Program to take input from the user and to find factors of a number:

I have imported a Scanner class from the java package.
I have created a public class named NumberFactors.
I have created a static method findFactor and passing a number of int type.
I am using for loop inside int i=1, i<=n and incrementing i.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I am declaring the variables number of int type and initializing with zero.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter a number.
I am storing the number into a number.
I am finding the factor of the entered number.
finally, I am displaying the result and 
I am closing the Scanner class.

Test Case:

the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 are complete divides the number 12 so they are called the factor of 12. 
Completly divisible means when we divide the number then it gives result zero.

The number which has only two factors 1 and itself, those numbers are called the prime number. 
The numbers which have more than two factors are called composite numbers.

To find the factor of a positive number “N” divide that number using natural numbers 1 to “N”. If the number is divisible by the natural number then that natural number is the factor. 
A number N can have factors only in between 1 to N.

Input-1:

Enter a number:: 6

Output-1:

The factors of the number are:: 1       2       3       6

Input-2:

Enter a number:: 10

Output-2:

The factors of the number are:: 1       2       5       10
