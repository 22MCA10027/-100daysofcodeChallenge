BubbleSort :
I have created a class named BubbleSort
and created a method named bub and defined an array a[] in it.
i have take a temp variable and i have difined the conditions for the bubblesort.
and then I have created a main class named BubbleSorting and defined main metho in it.

 i.e., ascending or descending order
