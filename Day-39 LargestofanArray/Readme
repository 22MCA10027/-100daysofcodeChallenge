Largest of an Array:

Firstly, I have created a public class named LargestArray.
I am writing java method to find largest number in array.
I am declaring a variable max.
I am comparing the remaining elements.
I am defining the main method to begin the execution.
I am creating a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am declaring the variables.
I am asking user to enter the length of an array.
I am asking user to enter the elements into the array.
I am storing the elements into the array given by the user.
I am closing the Scannerclass finally,
then
 I am displaying the largest number.
 
 Testcase:
 
 we have to enter the elements into an array, then 
 the largeast number will be displayed among the given numbers.
 
 Input-1:
 
 Enter the size of an array: 3
 
 Enter the elements into the array: 6,9,3,1
 
 Output-1: 
 
 The largest number is 9
  
   Input-2:
 
 Enter the size of an array: 6
 
 Enter the elements into the array: 6,9,3,88,99,208,999
 
 Output-1: 
 
 The largest number is 999
