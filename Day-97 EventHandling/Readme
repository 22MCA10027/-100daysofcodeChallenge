I have creeated a class named MyFrame and it extends with JFrame.

I have defined the Components of the Form.

by the user and act accordingly
I have  created a main class named BankRegestration.
I have created instance for MyFrame and I am calling from here.

Then I have registered the buttons with ActionListener and also the frame objects implements the ActionListener interface.
3>Later if the all details required in Bank registration form are filled, then after clicking submit button, then those are set to one Text Field with correponding text label.
4>Then reset button is pressed, the entered information is cleared and again new form is generated.
