Java Program for Mortgage Calculator using Method:

I have imported a Scanner class from the java package.
I have created a public class named Mortgage.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am declaring the variables principle, rate, time, payment as Double 
and initializing with 0.0.
I am asking user to Enter Principal Amount
I am asking user to Enter Interest Rate
I am asking user to Enter Time (in years)
I am calculating the monthly payment.
I am displaying the result and 
I am closing the Scanner class.
after that I am defining the method for Mortgage calculator.
convert rate for month format 
      rate = (rate/100)/12;
convert time in the terms of months
M = P [{r*(1+r)^n}/{(1+r)^n â€“ 1}]
