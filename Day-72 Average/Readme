Java program to find  average of three numbers:

firstly, I am importing the scanner class.
I have created a public class named AverageofThree.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter the num1.
I am storing value into the double variable num1. 
I am asking user to enter the num2.
I am storing value into the double variable num2. 
I am asking user to enter the num3.
I am storing value into the double variable num3. 
I am initializing double variable sum with 0.0
I am initializing double variable avg with 0.0
then sum = num1 + num2 + num3
avg = sum/3.
finally, I am displaying the average of three numbers.

TestCase:
