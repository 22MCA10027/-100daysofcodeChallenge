Java program to find HCF of two numbers:

I have created a public class named HcfProgram.
I have  created a method findHCF and passing parameters num1 and num2
I have declared a temperory variable to store hcf.
I am initializing a variable i with 1.
I am using while loop and returning hcf.
I am defining main method to begin the execution.
I am declaring the variables number1 and number2 
and initializing hcf with zero.
I am creating Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking user to enter two integer numbers.
I am finding HCF for both numbers.
I am displaying the HCF for two numbers.
I am closing the Scanner class.

TestCase:

HCF of 60 and 75 = 15 because 15 is the highest number which divides both 60 and 75 exactly.

Procedure to find the HCF or GCD of two numbers,
1) Take two numbers
2) Declare a temporary variable hcf to store the HCF value
3) Take an iterator variable and initialize it with 1 i.e. i=1
4) Check both numbers are divisible by iterator variable (i) or not?
5) If yes then hcf = i
6) Increase the iterator variable by 1
7) Repeat 4 to 6 step until the iterator variable is less than both numbers

Input-1:
 
  Enter two integer numbers:
    5
    6
    
Output-1:

  HCF(5,6) = 1
  
Input-2:
 
  Enter two integer numbers:
    5
    10
    
Output-1:

  HCF(5,10) = 5
