Sum of series for different Testcase:

I have created a public class named SumofSeriess.
I have defined the main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I have declared variables n and sum = 0.0.
I am asking user to input the value of of N.
If sum = sum + (1/(double)i)
I am calculating the sum of the series.
and finally, I am displaying the result.
 i.e, sum of the series upto N.
 
 Testcase:

In this program, while finding the sum value, we have to divide 1 by the number (or iteration variable).
The values of 1/2, 1/3 will be in floating-point numbers therefore to store them sum values take floating-point data types (either float or double).
 
 Input-1:
 
 Enter N value :
 
  6
  
  Output-1:
  
  Sum of series is = 2.44
  
  Input-2:
  
  Enter the N value :
  
  2
  
  Output-2:
  
  Sum of series is = 1.5
