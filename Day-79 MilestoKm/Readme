Java Program to Convert Miles To Kilometers:

I have imported Scanner class to take input from the user.
I have created a public class named MilestoKilometers.
I have defined main method to begin the execution.
I have created a Scanner class to take input from the user.
I am asking the user to enter the number of miles.
I am storing the miles into a variable miles as double type.
then, double kilometers = miles * 1.6093434.
I am displaying the Distance in Miles and
Distance in KiloMeters.
after that I am closing the Scanner class.

Testcase:

o convert miles to kilometers, as we know that 1 Mile = 1.60934 Kilometers.

Therefore the formula to convert miles to kilometers is (miles * 1.60934).
By using this formula we can convert the given miles to kilometers. 
Both kilometers & miles are units of length. The kilometer is denoted by “km” whereas the miles are denoted by “m”.
Kilo is usually prefixed by 1000. A mile is a unit of linear measurement which is equal to 1760 yards, which is approximately 1.609 kilometers.

EX:-
   
1) Mile = 4
Kilometer = 4 * 1.60934 = 6.43738 KM

2) Mile = 10
Kilometer = 10 * 1.60934 = 16.0934 KM

Input-1:

Enter the Miles: 10

Output-1:

Distance in Miles: 10.0 Miles
Distance in KiloMeters: 16.093434 KiloMeters

Input-2:

Enter the Miles: 999

Output-2:

Distance in Miles: 999.0 Miles
Distance in KiloMeters: 1607.7340566 KiloMeters
