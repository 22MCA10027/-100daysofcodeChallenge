firstly, I am importing Scanner class to take input from the user. 
I hava created a public class named SpecialNumber.
I am creating a method to Check the Special number
I am traverse through all digits of number
I have declared variables
compare sum and number
method to calculate factorial of an integer

I am defining the main method to begin the execution.
I am creating the scanner class.
take input from end-user
check number is Special number or not

Finally I am displaying the result.

TestCase:

145
=> 1! + 4! + 5!
=> 1 + 24 + 120
=> 145
The sum of the factorial of individual digits is the same as the original number 145. Hence, 145 is a Special number.

Similarly,
40585
=> 4! + 0! + 5! + 8! + 5!
=> 24 +1 + 120 + 40320 + 120
=> 40585
So, 40585 is also a Special number

1! = 1
So, 1 is also a Special number.
Sometimes the Special number is also called a Strong number, Krishnamurthy number, and Peterson number.

Procedure to develop a method to check the number is a Special number or not.

Input-1:

Enter an integer number:: 1

Output-1:

1 is a Special number.


Input-2:

Enter an integer number:: 145


Output-2:

145 is a Special number.
