NameSort:

firstly, I have created a class named NameSort
and I havdclared a main method.
I am intializing int n as 6.
I am intializing an array names as HariKrishna, Balaji, SaiPawan,SaiKishore,VenkataNagaPawan,Aadarsh.
I am using a temporory variable to store names in an array in alphabetical order.
I am intializing temp as index of names
index of names of i as index of names as j
index of names of j as temp
and finally I am printing the names as an alphabetical order.
