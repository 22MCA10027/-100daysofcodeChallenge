Java Program to find the number of Occurences of "the"

String Occurence:

 Firstly, I have created a public class named StringOccurence,to access everybody.
 I am declaring the main method to statrt the execution.
 I am taking a Scanner class to take input from the user.
 I am taking an array s and intializing it to split function
 I am intializing count as zero.
 for i:s and if i is equals to an object "the"
 then, finally print the number of times "the" Occurs.
 
 TestCases:
 
 1.It will return the number of Occurences, If there will be the objects for what you are looking for.
 2. It will return 0, If the number of Occurences if there will not be the objects for what you are looking for.

  Output-2:
